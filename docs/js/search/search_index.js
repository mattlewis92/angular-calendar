It now respects the minimumEventHeight input instead.\n\nTo restore the old behaviour you will need to set minimumEventHeight appropriately (by default it's 30 so should continue to work as expected for most users)\n\nwhen using the moment date formatter, the day view title format has changed to be locale aware. If you prefer the old behaviour you can restore it by overriding the dayViewTitle method in the moment date formatter like so:\n\nclass CustomMomentDateFormatter extends CalendarMomentDateFormatter {\n\n  public dayViewTitle({ date, locale }: DateFormatterParams): string {\n    return this.moment(date).locale(locale).format('dddd, D MMMM, YYYY');\n  }\n\n}\nweek-view: the drag behaviour now mimicks the resize behaviour where you can drag an event down to move it into the next day. To restore the old behaviour you can use the new validateEventTimesChanged input to control where an event can be dragged.\nweek-view: events on the week and day view will now always be at least 30 pixels high by default. To restore the old behaviour you can set [minimumEventHeight]=\"1\".\n\nFeatures\n\nadd support for rtl (caaf96c), closes #1203\nallow timezone offset to be overridden in the date adapter

required as a peer dependency\n\nIf implementing a custom adapter, the max function signature has changed to accept an array of dates, instead of an infinite argument list.\nThe date adapters no longer accept strings as input arguments.\n\nweek-view: If extending the root week view component to override the template you must make the following changes:\n\nWrap the time events with \n\nChange  0\"> to  0 && daysInWeek !== 1\">\n\nAdd [isTimeLabel]=\"daysInWeek === 1\" to the bottom  elements\n\nThe trackBy function trackByDayOrWeekEvent was split into trackByWeekAllDayEvent and trackByWeekTimeEvent\n\nweek-view: if using a custom headerTemplate on the week view, then you must now add let-dragEnter=\"dragEnter\" to the templates variables and (dragEnter)=\"dragEnter.emit({ date: day.date })\" onto the mwlDroppable element.\n\nthe columnHeaderClicked output on the month view now exposes an object instead of just the ISO day number\n\n\nBefore:\ncolumnHeaderClicked=\"columnHeaderClicked($event)\"After:\ncolumnHeaderClicked=\"columnHeaderClicked($event.isoDayNumber)\"\nday-view: The day and week view have now merged. For most users this should be a seamless migration, however there are some edge cases that you may need to take account for:\n\nAny custom styles you used for the day view will need to be adjusted. The cal-day-view-theme sass mixin is now gone as all the styles are shared between the week and day view.\nThe eventWidth option is removed, events now fill the available width.\nIf using [daysInWeek]=\"1\" on the week view, the date and title formatters for the day view will be used instead.\nThe week view now has a border top applied to the top of the component container, rather than the top of the day headers container.\nThe getDayView and getDayViewHourGrid functions have been removed from the CalendarUtils service.\nThe following interfaces from calendar-utils were renamed: DayViewHourSegment -> WeekViewHourSegment, DayViewHour -> WeekViewHour, DayViewEvent -> WeekViewTimeEvent\nThe day view scheduler demo is now based off the week view instead, please check the updated demo code for how to migrate: https://mattlewis92.github.io/angular-calendar/#/day-view-scheduler\nIf using a custom template for the hourSegmentTemplate, you must pass let-isTimeLabel=\"isTimeLabel\" as a local variable and then change  to \n\nthe dist files are no longer annotated for usage with closure compiler.\n\nBug Fixes\n\nensure compatibility with angular 9 and ivy (d4fdfb3), closes

If you were relying on it being transparent before you will need to override with css.

eventRow of view.allDayEventRows; trackBy:trackByIndex\"with \n*ngFor=\"let eventRow of view.allDayEventRows; trackBy:trackById\"\nIf extending the CalendarMonthViewComponent you must add

To migrate:\n\nInstall date-fns with npm:\nnpm i date-fnsAdd the date-fns calendar-utils adapter to the first argument of the CalendarModule.forRoot method:\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { CalendarModule, DateAdapter } from 'angular-calendar';\nimport { adapterFactory } from 'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    CalendarModule.forRoot({\n      provide: DateAdapter,\n      useFactory: adapterFactory\n    })\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}For system.js users you will also need to add the following entries to your systemjs config:\n'calendar-utils': 'npm:calendar-utils/bundles/calendar-utils.umd.js',\n'calendar-utils/date-adapters/date-fns': 'npm:calendar-utils/date-adapters/date-fns/index.js',\n'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns': 'npm:angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns/index.js'\nweek-view: the format of the week view title has changed from Week d of yyyy to MMM d - MMM d, yyyy. You can override this by using a custom date formatter.\nday-view: the allDayEventTemplate option was removed from the day view. To migrate use the eventTemplate input and check if dayEvent.event.allDay is set in the template\nWeek view events will now appear on the bottom time grid. To restore the old behaviour you can set allDay: true on the event to make it appear at the top.\n\nPeople extending the CalendarWeekViewComponent will probably have to adjust their child component as the template and internal component api has changed significantly.\n\nmonth-view: If using a custom openDayEventsTemplate for the month view you must now wrap your template with:\n\nand then you must add the collapse animation to the component that contains the open day events :\nimport { collapseAnimation } from 'angular-calendar';\n\n// add this to your component metadata\nanimations: [collapseAnimation]\ntooltip: all tooltips now default to auto positioning, you can use the tooltipPlacement input on all components to override this behaviour though\nevent-clicked: eventClicked now fires whenever the event container instead of the event title is clicked\nday-view: previously events with no end date that were resized would emit an empty end time, now they will emit a sensible default new end date\nresizable: only one event at a time can now be resized on the day or week views\nweek-view: if you were extending the week view component then the internal API has changed slightly and you may need to adjust your app\nmonth-view: Custom template users will now need to add a \"dragActiveClass='cal-drag-active'\" anywhere they use an mwlDraggable directive\n\nIf using the mwlDraggable directive anywhere else in your app you will need to apply pointer-events: none to the element yourself when it's being dragged. This can be done with the dragActiveClass option\n\nday-view: if you were extending the day view component then the internal API has changed slightly and you may need to adjust your app\ndeep module imports angular-calendar/modules/{common,month,week,day} are no longer supported as the package is now treeshakable. To migrate, adjust your imports to be from angular-calendar directly\nmoment: the moment weekViewColumnSubHeader format has changed for consistency with the other date formatters\nthere were some minor breaking changes in the drag and drop library that might affect your app if you were using it outside of the calendar.

The successor of angular-bootstrap-calendar.\nGetting started\n\nng add (recommended)\nng add angular-calendarManual setup (ng add will do this all for you)\nFirst install through npm:\nnpm install --save angular-calendar date-fnsNext include the CSS file in the global (not component scoped) styles of your app:\n/* angular-cli file: src/styles.css */\n@import \"../node_modules/angular-calendar/css/angular-calendar.css\";Finally import the calendar module into your apps module:\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { CalendarModule, DateAdapter } from 'angular-calendar';\nimport { adapterFactory } from 'angular-calendar/date-adapters/date-fns';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    CalendarModule.forRoot({\n      provide: DateAdapter,\n      useFactory: adapterFactory,\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class MyModule {}In order to allow the most flexibility for all users there is a substantial amount of boilerplate required to get up and running. Please see the demos list for a series of comprehensive examples of how to use this library within your application.\nOnce you are up and running, to access a full list of options for each component, the individual APIs are documented here: mwl-calendar-month-view, mwl-calendar-week-view and mwl-calendar-day-view.\n\nPlease note: angular-calendar uses Scarf to collect anonymized installation analytics. These analytics help support the maintainers of this library. However, if you'd like to opt out, you can do so by setting scarfSettings.enabled = false in your project's package.json. Alternatively, you can set the environment variable SCARF_ANALYTICS=false before you install.\n\nDocumentation\n\nTo see all available API options, take a look at the auto generated documentation. You may find it helpful to view the examples on the demo page.\nBreaking changes\n\nWhere possible this library will strictly adhere to semver and only introduce API breaking changes in 0.x releases or new major versions post 1.0. The only exception to this is if you are using custom templates or extending the base components to add additional functionality, whereby critical bug fixes may introduce breakages as the internal API changes.\nFAQ\n\nIs this library AoT and universal compatible?\nYes.\nWhat major versions of angular does this library support?\n\n\n\nAngular major\nLast supported angular-calendar version\n\n\n\n\n15.x and higher\nlatest version\n\n\n14.x\n0.30.1\n\n\n12.x - 13.x\n0.29.0\n\n\n6.x - 11.x\n0.28.28\n\n\n5.x\n0.24.1\n\n\n4.x\n0.22.3\n\n\n2.x\n0.9.1\n\n\n\nNo styles are appearing?\nNo component styles are included with each component to make it easier to override them (otherwise you’d have to use !important on every rule that you customised). Thus you need to import the CSS file separately from node_modules/angular-calendar/css/angular-calendar.css.\nHow come there are so many dependencies?\nWhen building the calendar some parts were found to be reusable so they were split out into their own modules. Only the bare minimum that is required is included with the calendar, there is no extra code than if there were no dependencies. date-fns especially only imports directly the functions it needs and not the entire library.\nThe month, week or day view doesn’t meet my project requirements, but the other views do.\nBuild your own component to replace that view, and use it in place of the one this library provides. It’s impossible to provide a calendar component that meets everyones use cases, hopefully though at least some of the day / week / month view components provided can be customised with the calendars API enough to be of some use to most projects.\nHow come there’s no year view like the ng1 version?\nAs there are so many events to show on each month, it doesn’t provide a lot of value and is just an extra burden to maintain. There is nothing to stop someone from building a new lib like angular-calendar-year-view though ;)\nDoes this calendar work with mobile?\nThis library is not optimised for mobile. Due to the complex nature of a calendar component, it is non trivial to build a calendar that has a great UX on both desktop and mobile. It is recommended to build your own calendar component for mobile that has a dedicated UX. You may be able to get some degree of mobile support by setting some custom CSS rules for smaller screens on the month view and showing less days on the week view.\nHow do I use a custom template?\nAll parts of this calendar can be customised via the use of an ng-template. The recipe for applying one is as follows:\n\nFind the template you would like to customise for the month, week or day view component. You can find all available custom templates by reading the documentation for each component. For this example we will pick the cellTemplate from the month view.\nNext find the corresponding child component that will render the template by viewing the source. For our example of the month view cell it is this component\nNow copy the template source for your chosen template into your own component and modify as your see fit.\nFinally pass the template to the components input: \nYou can see an e2e working example of this here\n\nWhat is the browser compatibility?\nAll evergreen browsers supported by angular.\nDoes this library require bootstrap?\nNo! While the demo site uses bootstrap, it isn't a requirement of this library. The styling is designed to adapt to whatever global styling your app has.\nAngular 1 version\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-bootstrap-calendar\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nPrepare your environment\n\nInstall Node.js (>=14.19.0 or >=16.9.0)\nInstall pnpm: corepack enable\nInstall local dev dependencies: pnpm install while current directory is this repo\n\nDevelopment server\nRun pnpm start to start a development server on port 8000 with auto reload + tests.\nTesting\nRun pnpm test to run tests once or pnpm test:watch to continually run tests.\nRelease\n\nBump the version in package.json (once the module hits 1.0 this will become automatic)\n\npnpm release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2018 Matt Lewis\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
